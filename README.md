# Flight-of-the-Coffee-Bean-FCB-
This will be a small project that will take the coffee names and prices from a coffee roaster's website and display them in a file. As I learn more about programming I may expand upon it.

This projext is expected to take until the beginning of 2017 to complete as I'm new to programming. 

For more information on this project and the features I am looking to include please refer to the wiki: https://github.com/Nathan-Mountfort/Flight-of-the-Coffee-Bean-FCB-/wiki
